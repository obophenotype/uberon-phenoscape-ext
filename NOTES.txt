How was phenotype-ext.owl created?
----------------------------------

Phenotype-ext contains:

* an owl:imports axiom to uberon/merged
* class axioms for 'unique' terms in AAO, TAO and VSAO (aka ATV), with uberon IDs

here 'unique' means anatomical structures not covered in the central
uberon ontology.

Thus, when bring in in AAO, we discard AAO:phalanx and
AAO:nasal_opening but retain the axioms for AAO 'fenestra
nasolateralis', giving this an uberon ID (AAO:0000367 -->
UBERON:3000167).

TODO:
include provenance info for classes sourced from outside Uberon

What happened to TAO/AAO/VSAO structures that were covered by Uberon?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Uberon already includes classes such as forelimb, cranial nerve II,
liver, proximal phalanx etc. A lot of work has gone into ensuring
correctness and cross-taxon applicability, and for many design
documents are available. Thus when creating phenoscape-ext from "ATV"
we discard the representation of these classes in the source ontology.

We also retain the original text definition through an
"external_definition" annotation property, and we make not of any
axioms that get lost in the generation process. These annotations are
only visible in Protege.

Cell types
----------

cell types are currently a bit of a mess, as these are duplicated
across multiple ontologies without proper integration to CL. Currently
there are some duplicates declared in phenoscape-ext. These should
eventually be removed - there is no need for phenoscape to extend CL,
everything you need should have a CL ID.
